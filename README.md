# BMC tpl\\tplpre language support in Sublime Text 2\\3

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [tpl](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/DISCO111/The+Pattern+Language+TPL) in Sublime Text.

Originally made. Have also re-made version for [Atom](https://github.com/triaglesis/language-tplpre)

Build Logic for this package is not included, you can find it in separate [repo](https://github.com/triaglesis/BMC_TPL_IDE)

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

### Additional functionality will be added soon in both versions for Sublime Text and Atom.
